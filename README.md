Everyone always has specific places where they like their apps to go on their phone. It's muscle memory to get to them, and we take that layout for granted. But how confused would you be if someone rearranged your apps?

Fortunately for us, we can use CSS positioning to put our apps back in their original spots, just like in this iPhone!

If you look at the site in the browser, you'll notice the icons are all clumped together to the left of the iPhone. They're not even on the screen! Our job is to move the icons to their appropriate spots, just like in this image to the right.

## Let's Get Started

You should have `index.html` open in the browser and the text editor. You'll be coding your solution in `css/organizer.css`. Don't worry about `css/style.css` or `css/normalize.css`.

Your job is to get the app icons on the iPhone just like in the picture above. You can use absolute or relative positioning to get the job done. Remember, there is no "right" answer to this. As long as your code make the iPhone look the way you want it to, you did it right!
